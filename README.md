## Team members

* PM: Diana Pintoiu
* TESTER: Maria Movileanu
* DEVELOPERS: Larisa Pavel, Iulian Neacsu

## Programing language

1. Python

## Development Methodology

* Scrum

## Maze Generator:
- maze generator can be found in maze_gen_base.py

## Viewer:
- viewer implementation can be found in viewer.py

## Server:
- server impleentation can be found in main.py

All these files are called in main.py where the main logic resides.


## Meeting Notes

### Meeting Minutes 23-10-2024:


- Iulian:
	- to start implementation for maze generator
- Maria :
	- helps Iulian with Maze generator 
	- starts research about viewer
	- starts documentation (SDD)
- Larisa: 
	- starts research about AI Agents
	- testing reports - later
- Diana: - start implementation for server

### Meeting Notes 06.11.2024:

- Larisa and Maria finished maze_generator + viewer

- Diana and Iulica to finish server, json mapper, maze move make

- Maria works on fixing small issue for viewer.

- When maze generator and viewer done -> merge in the main branch

PS: Best of luck :)

### Meeting Notes 13.11.2024:

- Iulica to finish server with json mapper, maze move make

- Diana to start SDD documentation

- Larisa and Maria to start testing server, make unit tests for maze generator

- Diana to start unit tests for server after iulica finishes

### Meeting Notes 20.11.2024:

- Iulica to make an AI Agent

- Diana to finish SDD documentation, and testing all flows

- Larisa and Maria to finish testing, help Iulica with AI Agent

### Meeting Minutes 04-12-2024:


What needs to be done for the next Milestone:

- trap logic for AI agent implementation 
- [x] dash line implementation for ai agent (prediction for moves)
- [x] make AI agent want to make more moves in one turn
- make another AI agent with better solving logic
- Bug fixing on maze generation by image
- [x] route verification that maze is solvable with traps
- [x] make traps have different penalizations for each different trap, based on their effect
- make viewer possible for multiple agents to be seen


Order of events for next 2 weeks:

1. route verification that maze is solvable with traps
2. trap logic for AI agent implementation 
3. dash line implementation for ai agent (prediction for moves)
4. make AI agent want to make more moves in one turn

Tasks:
- Larisa to do task 1
- Maria to do task 2
- Diana to do task 3
- Iulian to do task 4

### Meeting Minutes 04-01-2025:
- Task 1: make viewer possible for multiple agents to be seen
- Task 2: Bug fixing on maze generation by image
- Task 3: trap logic for AI agent implementation 
- Task 4: make another AI agent with better solving logic
- Task 5: Make powerpoint presentation
- Task 6: Continue SDD

Tasks:
- Maria to do task 3, 6
- Larisa to do task 2, 5
- Diana to do task 4
- Iulian to do task 1
